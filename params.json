Given the limited visualizations Strava currently offers regarding club activities, we propose a visualization for Strava clubs, allowing cycling users to find prospective clubs, explore new routes and meet new partners. To better understand the problem space, we identified the design requirements by a literature review and interviews with end-users. Our implementation reduces the visual cluster and allows users to dynamically query with spatial and temporal dimensions, and it yields positive feedback in terms of systemâ€™s usability, visual appearance and the capability to facilitate interpersonal relationships.\r\n\r\n## Software\r\n\r\nTry out our visualization online [here](#).\r\n\r\n## Materials\r\n\r\n[Poster](https://github.com/CSE512-16S/fp-rickixie-taoaoao-collnwalkr-lilizeng99/raw/master/poster-cwalker2-yitaow-rickixie-lizeng.pdf),\r\n[Final Paper](https://github.com/CSE512-16S/fp-jheer-mcorrell-jhoffs/raw/master/final/paper-jheer-mcorrell-jhoffs.pdf),\r\n[Code](https://github.com/CSE512-16S/fp-rickixie-taoaoao-collnwalkr-lilizeng99)\r\n\r\n## Running Instructions\r\n\r\nAccess our visualization at http://cse512-16s.github.io/fp-jheer-mcorrell-jhoffs/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.",
